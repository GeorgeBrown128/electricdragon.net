A few years back I bought myself a HP1652B, that's an 80 channel logic
analyser, with a two channel 100 MHz scope inside too! (Not bad for Â£150 eh?)

In this post, I'll cover the repair I made to the unit after it suffered a
rather exciting failure.

# The Fault

I'd been using the thing for a few months, until one day it went up in a cloud
of very stinky smoke. I seem to recall the thing continued to run, but I
didn't dare leave it on long enough to see!

A quick investigation revealed that the problem was the fault of the mains
inlet filter, specifically a [Schaffner
FN-390](http://www.schaffner.com/product-storage/datasheets/fn-390).
Discussions online seem to suggest these devices, specifically of this era are
prone to failure if they're powered off for a long time. I imagine my 'scope
had been sat in a cupboard for many years before making it to me.

I'm now fairly confident the exact failure mode was the mains suppression caps
(X and Y class) failed. I've had HP equipment of a similar vintage that has
had failed mains caps. The smell of them was identical to this mains filter!

# The Repair

The repair seems pretty trivial, just replace the part. Indeed that was my
first port of call, but at nearly 30% of the cost of the instrument I was
hesitant. I really didn't need a module with a built in switch, since all
mains outlets in the UK are switched anyway. I also don't need the voltage
selector, since I don't plan on taking it anywhere outside the UK soon, never
mind outside Europe!

I thus opted to use a much cheaper equivalent part, a [TDK
B84771](http://en.tdk.eu/inf/30/db/emc_2014/B84771.pdf). Specifically
[this](http://uk.farnell.com/epcos/b84771a0008a000/filter-inlet-iec-8a-250v-ac-dc/dp/2317942)
was the part I used. I also added an inline fuse just in case. (When was the
last time you checked the fuse rating in your IEC lead before plugging it
in?!).

To mount it all, I would need some kind of bracket. My fabrication skills
aren't really up to the task. As it happened though, work had recently
invested in a 3D printer. With a bit of gentle persuasion, a colleague let me
use it, and also introduced me to [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).
OpenSCAD is a wonderful piece of software that lets you specify your models
using a very intuitive programming language. I'd spent a decent amount of time
in Google SketchUp and also AutoCAD in the past, but for me this has to be the
best way to 3D model.

code I'm afraid!

# The Result

This is the printed part from the printer. The edges are a bit rough as they
were trimmed with a knife. The first layer of the print flairs out quite a bit.

The back panel after my modification. I think I'd reprint the part in black if
I had a chance.

Overall I'm very pleased with the result. The new part seems to work fine, the
repair looks fairly professional, and I learned a whole host of new skills in
the process. Since this modification I've used 3D printing a number of times at
work for prototypes and even small production runs.
