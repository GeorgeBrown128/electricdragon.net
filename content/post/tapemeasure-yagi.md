Through the first half of 2016, British astronaut Tim Peake was aboard the 
ISS. During this time he carried out [a number of 2m FM voice contacts with 
schools.](https://principia.ariss.org/schools/).

For the first few contacts, I used a Baofeng handy with a 2m whip antenna, 
which worked quite well for listening in, but it was not ideal. I also tried 
using my very basic $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ antenna. This didn't seem to work 
much better, and I was starting to notice some pager interference coming in 
too.

In a bit of a hurry, I decided I should try out building the tape measure yagi 
I'd seen mentioned before. The next GB1SS contact was on the next day, so I 
made a quick trip to B&Q and got to work.

I used the nice metric guide written up by 
[G3ZOI](http://open-circuit.co.uk/wp/wb-yagi/). I wasn't able to get my hands 
on the bits he used, so I improvised a little.

I was building this in my university halls room, and didn't have access to a 
drill, so I also built it using as few holes as possible.
