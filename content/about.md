# Electronic Engineer
I'm currently an Electronic Engineering student of
[ECS](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) at the University of Southampton.
I am pursuing my MEng degree, and I'm currently in my first year.

I have also had he opportunity to gain industrial experience thanks to a [Year
in Industry](http://www.etrust.org.uk/the-year-in-industry) at [EA
Technology](http://www.eatechnology.com/). During this time I was able to hone
the skills I'd developed as a hobbyist, and learn a great deal more about my
industry.

The [IET](http://www.theiet.org/) has acknowledged my progress so far by
awarding me with a [Diamond Jubilee Scholarship]
(http://conferences.theiet.org/achievement/scholarships/diamond/index.cfm?origin=/diamond).
This award has already proved it's value to me by enabling me to acquire both
a new laptop, and test equipment. I can use these to further my hobby and
university work. I am incredibly grateful for the support from the IET. My
local newspaper covered the story, which can be found
[here](http://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/local/ex-caedmon-college-whitby-student-a-real-diamond-geezer-1-7772699).

# Electronics Hobbyist
Since I was young I've been fascinated by electronics. As a teen I steadily
got more and more involved in electronics, working on an array of projects.
The hobby electronics community was pivotal in this progression. I owe a lot
to [Dave Jones' EEVBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/) which kept me captivated
and provided a great deal of insight into the real engineering process.

# Radio Amateur
During my Year in Industry, I caught the amateur radio bug. Within 9 months I
had my full UK radio licence. I'm rarely on the air myself, but I try and get
involved when time allows. Recently I've been doing a lot of reception work,
specifically with weather satellites. I hope to document this soon!

You'll find me on the air as M6WTB and 2E0WTB. I haven't decided on a M0 call
yet! Unfortunately M0WTB is taken.
